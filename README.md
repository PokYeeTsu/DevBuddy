# DevBuddy

DevBuddy is an experimental modular code intelligence tool designed to index any software project and provide rich structural and semantic search. It aims to help developers understand codebases, find logic quickly, and build insights using a combination of parsing, embeddings, and knowledge graph techniques.

This repository contains the **open-core** version of DevBuddy.  
Advanced features (LLM orchestration, semantic reasoning, plugins) will be developed in private modules.
